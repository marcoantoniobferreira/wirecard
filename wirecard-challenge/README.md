# Architecture
The project was structured with packages separeted by business entities, and was used the pattern **Strategy** to build the payment behavior, and the pattern **Builder** to make object creation easier and more fluent, especially as they contain more than one attribute.
Some aspects was made respecting the Quarkus diretives, e.g. the setters and getters are created automatically by Panache in the entities.
